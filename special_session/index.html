It is co-sponsored by IEEE Biometrics Council and IEEE Computer Society . Its broad scope includes advances in fundamental computer vision, pattern recognition, and computer graphics; machine learning techniques relevant to face, gesture, and body motion; interdisciplinary research on behavioral analysis; new algorithms and applications. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
Face recognition & biometrics Face analysis and synthesis Body action and activity recognition Gesture recognition, analysis, and synthesis Affective computing and multi-modal interaction Psychological and behavioral analysis Perceptual and cognitive aspects of non-verbal interaction Databases and tools for FG Technologies and applications related to FG Privacy and ethical issues of FG FG Steering Committee Statement on Broadening ParticipationThe FG community is strongly committed to addressing issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion at our conference. Diversity has many dimensions, including gender, race, ethnicity, nation of origin, age, disabilities, religious belief, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and cultural background. There is no place for hatred and discrimination in the FG community or elsewhere.
For FG 2026, the BP Chairs are working with other members of the organizing committee to help foster a more inclusive, diverse, and equitable conference. Specifically, we will encourage the following:
improved diversity and inclusion in workshop and tutorial organizers and invited speakers by including diversity, equity, and inclusivity as part of the evaluation criteria; the submission of workshop and tutorial proposals that examine problems in equity, diversity, and inclusion from a technical perspective; networking events and support for affinity groups that are specifically aimed at building and nurturing networks in communities that are currently not well represented at FG; support for students to attend FG from communities that do not traditionally attend through travel grants and waived registration fees. FG'26 is committed to supporting students from communities that do not traditionally attend FG through registration and travel support. IEEE Biometrics Council makes a number of grants available for this purpose. Allocation is based on a combination of need, contribution to the conference, where you are traveling from, the community(ies) you identify with, and advisor support.

Foundation models (such as CLIP, GPT, etc.) enable robust feature extraction and transfer learning. In addition, generative models allow synthetic data generation, privacy-preserving learning, and advanced data augmentation techniques. Foundation and generative models are reshaping the field by improving accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in automatic face and gesture recognition. This special session aims to bring together researchers to discuss state-of-the-art advancements, applications, and challenges at the applications of foundation and generative models for face and gesture recognition. The special session will foster discussions that inspire innovation and address challenges in real-world applications of these advanced models.</p><p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Foundation and Generative Models in:<ul><li>Face and Gesture Recognition; Face Analysis</li><li>Body Action and Activity Recognition; Gesture Recognition and Analysis</li><li>Affective Computing and Multi-modal Interaction</li><li>Psychological and Behavioral Analysis</li><li>Template Security</li></ul></li><li>Generating Synthetic Datasets for Face, Body and Gesture</li><li>Privacy and Ethical Aspects of Applying Foundation Models to Face and Gesture Analysis, such as<ul><li>Unlearning in foundation and generative models</li><li>Safety of foundation models</li></ul></li></ul><h4 class="heading heading--4" id=special-session-2-smile-silent-motion-interpretation-and-lip-based-evaluation>Special Session 2: SMILE: Silent Motion Interpretation and Lip-based Evaluation</h4><p>Organizers: Georgia Fargetta (University of Catania, Italy), Massimo Orazio Spata (University of Catania, Italy), Giulia Orru (University of Cagliari, Italy), and Alessandro Ortis (University of Catania, Italy).</p><p>The session aims to consolidate research efforts in lip-based communication analysis, visual speech recognition, silent interaction, and lip-motion-driven biometrics. SMILE is closely aligned with the Silent Lipreading Competition 2026, creating a unified venue for presenting benchmark results, novel methodologies, multimodal evaluation protocols, and emerging applications in silent communication understanding. By fostering contributions related to lip reading, lip-driven gesture analysis, multimodal accessibility, and facial motion–based deepfake generation or detection, the session seeks to advance the study of silent human communication and its role in assistive technologies, privacy-preserving AI, and human-centered machine perception.</p><p>We invite submissions addressing, but not limited to, the following topics:</p><ul><li>Silent and audio-visual lip reading;</li><li>Visual speech recognition and lip-based expression understanding;</li><li>Lip-motion-based biometric identification and authentication;</li><li>Sign language recognition integrating lip motion cues;</li><li>Evaluation methodologies, benchmark protocols, and dataset bias analysis;</li><li>Generative, self-supervised, and cross-modal learning for lip features;</li><li>Robust lip reading under occlusion, pose, and illumination variations;</li><li>Human-centered and assistive AI applications;</li><li>Deepfake reenactment generation and detection based on lip motion and facial dynamics;</li><li>3D modelling and reconstruction of lip, face, and head motion.</li></ul><h4 class="heading heading--4" id=submission-instruction>Submission instruction</h4><p>When you create a submission of Round 2 at the <a class=link href=https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/FG2026 rel=external>submission system CMT</a>
