While 2D generative models have seen explosive growth, 3D human synthesis has often remained constrained by data scarcity and computational overhead. We bridge this gap by investigating the pre-training and post-training regimes for 3D avatars. We present findings demonstrating that pre-training on massive, diverse datasets—followed by targeted fine-tuning on high-fidelity, curated &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; data—unlocks unprecedented generalization. This approach enables robust inference on out-of-distribution data, far surpassing traditional methods.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
