She earned her Ph.D. in Engineering from Osaka University in 2004, after which she worked at the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Bielefeld University, and then Osaka University. Since 2019, she has been leading the Cognitive Developmental Robotics Lab at the University of Tokyo. Her research encompasses cognitive developmental robotics, computational neuroscience, and assistive technologies for developmental disorders. Dr. Nagai employs computational methods to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms involved in social cognitive development. In acknowledgment of her work, she was elected to 'World's 50 Most Renowned Women in Robotics' in 2020, '35 Women in Robotics Engineering and Science' in 2022, and 'Forbes JAPAN Women In Tech 30' in 2024, among other recognitions.",
