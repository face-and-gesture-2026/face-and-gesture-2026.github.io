# Call for Papers
The IEEE conference series on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition is the premier international forum for research in image and video-based face, gesture, and body movement recognition. Its broad scope includes advances in fundamental computer vision, pattern recognition, computer graphics, and machine learning techniques relevant to face, gesture, and body action, as well as innovative algorithms and analyses of specific applications.

The 20th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2026) marks a milestone as the 20th conference in the series, returning to Japan after nearly three decades. FG 2026 will be held from May 25th to 29th, 2026, in Kyoto, Japan, as an in-person event. The conference invites submissions addressing both foundational and emerging research topics in face and gesture recognition.

#### Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Face, gesture, and body detection and tracking
- Robust recognition under varying conditions (pose, occlusion, illumination)
- Generative modeling and neural rendering (e.g., deepfakes, AR/VR)
- Advanced learning paradigms (self-supervised, few-shot, foundation models)
- Soft biometrics and behavioral analysis (emotion, personality, demographics)
- Multimodal fusion and cross-modal analysis
- Benchmark development and dataset creation
- Cognitive and bio-inspired vision systems
- Bias mitigation, interpretability, and ethical considerations
- Real-world applications and deployment studies

### Paper format and submission
#### Format

Submitted papers may not be accepted or under review elsewhere. FG 2026 will consider two different paper types, i.e., Short and Long Papers. Authors should carefully consider the category before submitting a paper.

- Short papers: 4 pages + 1 page for references
- Long papers: 8 pages + references

The main difference between the two is in the size of the contributions, rather than in their importance or technical quality. Please visit the submission page for additional details on paper formatting and paper types. Accepted papers will be published and indexed in IEEEXplore.

**Long papers (8 pages excluding references)** should present original reports of substantive new research techniques, findings, and applications. They should place the work within the field and clearly indicate innovative aspects. Research procedures and technical methods should be presented in sufficient detail to ensure scrutiny and reproducibility. Results should be clearly communicated, and implications of the contributions/findings for FG and beyond should be explicitly discussed.

**Short papers (4 pages + 1 page for references)** should present original and highly promising research or applications. Merit will be assessed in terms of originality, importance, and technical quality, more so than scope and maturity of the work.

Please note that both long and short papers will undergo the same review process. Rejected long papers will NOT be considered for acceptance as short papers, except for rare cases when reviewers unanimously make this recommendation. Both long and short papers can be accepted for oral or poster presentation.

Supplementary materials are optional and can be submitted with your paper (as pdf or zip). The deadline for all supplementary materials is the same as the paper submission deadline.


#### Submission
The IEEE FG 2026 will use a two-round reviewing procedure. Round 1 submissions may receive one of three decisions: accept, revise and resubmit to Round 2 or reject. Submissions that receive a reject decision in Round 1 are not eligible for resubmission to Round 2. Round 2 submissions have two possible outcomes: accept or reject. The final decision is provided without an opportunity for a rebuttal. Submissions to Round 2 may be either new papers or revised papers from Round 1. Revised papers from Round 1 are re-evaluated based on the original reviews and the authors' response. For revised submissions in round 2, we will do our best to have the same meta-reviewer and reviewers review the revised submission.

New papers can be submitted in either the first or the second round. The primary benefit of submitting in Round 1 is that submissions can be invited for resubmission to Round 2, enabling authors to address reviewer concerns and significantly improve their work.

Paper submissions are accepted through CMT:

#### Submissions steps
1. Prepare your manuscripts as per the IEEE specifications using the LaTeX or Word templates for both Long and Short Papers
2. Carefully proofread your submission
3. Submit to the FG 2026 CMT system: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/FG2026

**NOTE:**<br>
a) List all authors during initial submission. The list of authors must be finalized by the abstract submission deadline and cannot be modified thereafter. Authors' order may be modified by the full paper submission deadline.<br>
b) Authors may update the abstract and title until the full paper submission deadline. However, the overall topic and core content of the paper must remain consistent.

Papers presented at FG 2026 will be sent for inclusion into the IEEE Xplore digital library, including workshop papers. If a paper is accepted, it is assumed that the author will register and attend the conference to present the paper. Papers that are not presented will not be published in IEEE Xplore.

#### Awards and IEEE TBIOM Special Issue
Several awards will be given out to the best papers from FG 2026, including (1) the best paper award, (2) the best student paper award, and (3) the test-of-time award.

A selection of the best relevant papers from FG 2026 will be invited to contribute to a special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Biometrics, Behavior, and Identity Science (IEEE TBIOM), subject to approval by the journal (pending).

**Conference 25-29 May, 2026**

#### arXiv Policy
FG 2026 does not consider a paper on arXiv.org as a dual submission.

#### Ethics statement
FG 2026 requires authors to complete a checklist on their adherence to ethical principles at the time of submission. An explicit ethics statement must be included in the paper depending on your answers to the checklist. For more details on the specific guidelines, authors should refer to the [ethics guidlines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r0uWqoERCr_pRlPszh6CtD_3z2gnCe8XdBa-3Le9lpM/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Anonymization policy
Authors should remove author and institutional identities from the title and header areas of the paper. There should also be no acknowledgments. Authors can leave citations to their previous work unanonymized so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account. However, they should cite their own work in the third person (e.g., “[22] found that…”)
