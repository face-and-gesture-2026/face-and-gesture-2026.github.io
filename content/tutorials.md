# Call for Tutorial Proposals

We invite tutorial proposals for the 2026 IEEE Conference on Automatic
Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2026) in Kyoto, Japan. The tutorials should complement and enhance the scientific program of FG 2026 by providing authoritative and comprehensive overviews of growing themes that are of sufficient relevance with respect to the state-of-the-art and the conference topics.

Accepted tutorials will be held on either May 25 or May 29, 2026, in the same venue as the FG 2026 main conference. We solicit proposals on any topic of interest to the FG community. Interdisciplinary topics that could attract a significant cross-section of the community are highly encouraged. We particularly welcome tutorials which address advances in emerging areas not previously covered in an FG related tutorial.


#### Submission Procedure

Tutorial proposals should be submitted via email to <a href="mailto:ukita@toyota-ti.ac.jp">Norimichi Ukita</a> and <a href="mailto:kniinuma@fujitsu.com">Koichiro Niinuma</a>. The title of the email should be: **Tutorial proposal for IEEE FG 2026**. The proposal should consist of a PDF file appended to the email, and include the following information:

+ Title
+ Proposer’s contact information and short CV
+ Names of any additional lecturers and their short CV
+ Tutorial description and description of relevance to the FG community
and an evaluation plan
+ References and experience of the instructors with respect to the
proposed tutorial topic
+ Planned length of the tutorial
+ List of relevant tutorials recently presented in other conferences
+ Requirements (e.g., facilities, internet access, etc.),
+ Other useful information (e.g., estimated attendance, slides/notes
available, etc.).

The main conference will provide rooms, equipment, and coffee breaks for
the tutorials.


#### Review process

Tutorial proposals will be evaluated on the basis of their estimated benefit for the community and their fit within the tutorials program as a whole. Factors to be considered include relevance, timeliness, importance, and audience appeal; suitability for presentation in a half or full day format; past experience and qualifications of the instructors. Selection will also be based on the overall distribution of topics, expected attendance, and specialties of the intended audiences.
