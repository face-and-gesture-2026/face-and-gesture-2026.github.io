# Call for Demos

The 20th IEEE Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2026) invites researchers from academia and industry to present live demonstrations of their research findings and face/gesture recognition systems to conference participants.

These demonstrations aim to provide tangible, practical, and interactive validation of the presenters' research concepts and scientific or engineering contributions. The primary objective is to offer researchers and practitioners a platform for discussing operational face/gesture recognition systems, applications, prototypes, or proof-of-concepts. Such a setting enables conference attendees to observe and engage with live demonstrations showcasing innovative solutions and concepts and to witness cutting-edge research in action.

Demos are NOT restricted solely to the papers accepted by FG 2026 or its associated workshops. We encourage the submission of any demo that demonstrates the effectiveness of face and gesture recognition methods. These demos may originate from papers accepted at other venues (e.g., extended works), such as peer-reviewed conferences or journals. However, it is expected that these demos present innovative and novel research outcomes.


#### Expected Contents

We strongly encourage submissions in all areas related to face and gesture analysis and synthesis, as outlined in the general call for papers for IEEE FG 2026, which can be found at the following link:
 https://fg2026.ieee-biometrics.org/


#### Submission Guidelines

All submissions will undergo a peer-review process. Anonymous submission is not mandatory, and the submission materials should include the following:

##### Proposal (Mandatory)
A one-page proposal (including references) formatted according to the standard IEEE FG 2026 guidelines.

This proposal should provide a comprehensive description of the demonstrated system and articulate the novelty and significance of the contribution to the FG community. Special emphasis should be placed on detailing the specific demonstration scenarios for the system. This should encompass how the audience will engage with the demo, the range of functionalities it offers, user scenarios, interface design, interaction options, and more.

In particular, the proposal should address the following aspects for the evaluation:

- What is the scientific or engineering concept behind the work?
- What is the novelty of the work and how is the work different from existing systems or techniques?
- What is the expected impact on the FG community?
- What will be actually shown during the demo?
- What type of interactivity will be supported, for onsite and/or online scenarios?


##### Supplementary Material (Optional)

If you have any special requests or unique requirements regarding the configuration of your demo booth, you are welcome to submit an additional one-page PDF file detailing these specifications. This document will help us accommodate any specific needs you may have for your demo presentation. Although not required, adding a video or a link to it is encouraged, as it can help convey the content more clearly.


#### Submission Procedure

Demo proposals must be submitted electronically in PDF format through CMT. The configuration description should be submitted as Supplementary Material through the same CMT. Please ensure that all uploaded content falls within the overall submission size limit of 100 MB.

Demonstration presentations that have been accepted, accompanied by a one-page proposal adhering to FG2026â€™s camera-ready format, will be featured in the proceedings of FG2026.
