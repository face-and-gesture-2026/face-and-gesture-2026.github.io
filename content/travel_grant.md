# Broadening Participation (BP) Travel Grants
FG 2026 will offer a limited number of Broadening Participation (BP) Travel Grants, supported by the IEEE Biometrics Council, to foster a more diverse and inclusive research community.
The grants are intended to support authors of accepted papers who self-identify as members of underrepresented or marginalized groups and who lack sufficient funding to attend the conference.
Support will be provided in the form of travel reimbursement. Detailed eligibility criteria, application instructions, and deadlines will be circulated via CMT to authors after paper acceptance notifications.
