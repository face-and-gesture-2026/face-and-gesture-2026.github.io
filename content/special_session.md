# Call for Special Session and Panel Proposals
The 20th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2026) will be held in Kyoto, Japan, from May 25-29, 2026. FG is the premier international forum for research in image and video-based face, gesture, and body movement recognition. 

#### What is a special session in FG 2026
A special session focuses on a specific topic within the broader domain of face and gesture recognition. Unlike a workshop, a special session is fully integrated into the main conference program. Papers submitted to a special session will be included in the conference proceedings and undergo the same rigorous peer-review process as regular submissions. All papers must present original research and adhere to the general FG submission guidelines.

Upon acceptance of a special session proposal, a dedicated Subject Area will be created in the paper submission system (CMT). The special session organizers will serve as Area Chairs and oversee the review process for submissions within their topic. If enough papers from the special session are accepted, an oral session will be scheduled during FG 2026, and the organizers will be invited to chair that session. 

Proposals may address any topic within the broader area of face and gesture recognition, modeling, and analysis. We particularly encourage submissions that explore emerging research directions, novel application domains, and new challenges related to face and gesture. Interdisciplinary topics that bring new perspectives to the FG community are also highly welcome. Proposers should demonstrate a strong track record in the proposed field.

#### What is a panel in FG 2026
A panel is a focused discussion session that brings together experts to debate and explore timely, controversial, or emerging topics in the field of face and gesture recognition. Unlike a special session, a panel does not involve paper submissions or formal proceedings. Instead, it provides a dynamic forum for interactive dialogue, diverse viewpoints, and thought-provoking exchanges between panelists and the audience. Panel sessions aim to stimulate new ideas, address key challenges, and foster active community engagement. 

#### Proposal Submission Guidelines
Proposals should be submitted to the Special Session and Panel Chairs with the subject field “FG 2026 Proposal: [title of session]”.

A proposal must include the following information:
- The title of the proposed Special Session or Panel.
- A brief description of the topic, including how it stands apart from the regular FG topics/sessions.
- Contact information and short bio of the organizers.
- For a Special Session: a list of proposed contributions to the special session (including authors, title, and short abstract).
- For a Panel: a list of proposed panelists and their expected perspectives/contributions.
