          description: |
            The IEEE conference series on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition is the premier international forum for research in image and video-based face, gesture, and body movement recognition.
            It is co-sponsored by [IEEE Biometrics Council](https://ieee-biometrics.org/) and [IEEE Computer Society](https://www.computer.org/).
            Its broad scope includes advances in fundamental computer vision, pattern recognition, and computer graphics;
            machine learning techniques relevant to face, gesture, and body motion;
            interdisciplinary research on behavioral analysis;
            new algorithms and applications.
            Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

            - Face recognition & biometrics
            - Face analysis and synthesis
            - Body action and activity recognition
            - Gesture recognition, analysis, and synthesis
            - Affective computing and multi-modal interaction
            - Psychological and behavioral analysis
            - Perceptual and cognitive aspects of non-verbal interaction
            - Databases and tools for FG
            - Technologies and applications related to FG
            - Privacy and ethical issues of FG

            <br><br>

            #### FG Steering Committee Statement on Broadening Participation
            The FG community is strongly committed to addressing issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion at our conference. Diversity has many dimensions, including gender, race, ethnicity, nation of origin, age, disabilities, religious belief, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and cultural background. There is no place for hatred and discrimination in the FG community or elsewhere.

            For FG 2026, the BP Chairs are working with other members of the organizing committee to help foster a more inclusive, diverse, and equitable conference. Specifically, we will encourage the following:
            - improved diversity and inclusion in workshop and tutorial organizers and invited speakers by including diversity, equity, and inclusivity as part of the evaluation criteria;
            - the submission of workshop and tutorial proposals that examine problems in equity, diversity, and inclusion from a technical perspective;
            - networking events and support for affinity groups that are specifically aimed at building and nurturing networks in communities that are currently not well represented at FG;
            - support for students to attend FG from communities that do not traditionally attend through travel grants and waived registration fees.

            FG'26 is committed to supporting students from communities that do not traditionally attend FG through registration and travel support. IEEE Biometrics Council makes a number of grants available for this purpose. Allocation is based on a combination of need, contribution to the conference, where you are traveling from, the community(ies) you identify with, and advisor support.
