          description: |
            The IEEE conference series on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition is the premier international forum for research in image and video-based face, gesture, and body movement recognition.
            It is co-sponsored by [IEEE Biometrics Council](https://ieee-biometrics.org/) and [IEEE Computer Society](https://www.computer.org/).
            Its broad scope includes advances in fundamental computer vision, pattern recognition, and computer graphics;
            machine learning techniques relevant to face, gesture, and body motion;
            interdisciplinary research on behavioral analysis;
            new algorithms and applications.
            Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

            - Face recognition & biometrics
            - Face analysis and synthesis
            - Body action and activity recognition
            - Gesture recognition, analysis, and synthesis
            - Affective computing and multi-modal interaction
            - Psychological and behavioral analysis
            - Perceptual and cognitive aspects of non-verbal interaction
            - Databases and tools for FG
            - Technologies and applications related to FG
            - Privacy and ethical issues of FG
