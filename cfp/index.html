FG 2026 will consider two different paper types, i.e., Short and Long Papers. Authors should carefully consider the category before submitting a paper.</p><ul><li>Short papers: 4 pages + 1 page for references</li><li>Long papers: 8 pages + references</li></ul><p>The main difference between the two is in the size of the contributions, rather than in their importance or technical quality. Please visit the submission page for additional details on paper formatting and paper types. Accepted papers will be published and indexed in IEEEXplore.</p><p><strong>Long papers (8 pages excluding references)</strong> should present original reports of substantive new research techniques, findings, and applications. They should place the work within the field and clearly indicate innovative aspects. Research procedures and technical methods should be presented in sufficient detail to ensure scrutiny and reproducibility. Results should be clearly communicated, and implications of the contributions/findings for FG and beyond should be explicitly discussed.</p><p><strong>Short papers (4 pages + 1 page for references)</strong> should present original and highly promising research or applications. Merit will be assessed in terms of originality, importance, and technical quality, more so than scope and maturity of the work.</p><p>Please note that both long and short papers will undergo the same review process. Rejected long papers will NOT be considered for acceptance as short papers, except for rare cases when reviewers unanimously make this recommendation. Both long and short papers can be accepted for oral or poster presentation.</p><p>Supplementary materials are optional and can be submitted with your paper (as pdf or zip). The deadline for all supplementary materials is the same as the paper submission deadline.</p><h4 class="heading heading--4" id=submission>Submission</h4><p>The IEEE FG 2026 will use a two-round reviewing procedure. Round 1 submissions may receive one of three decisions: accept, revise and resubmit to Round 2 or reject. Submissions that receive a reject decision in Round 1 are not eligible for resubmission to Round 2. Round 2 submissions have two possible outcomes: accept or reject. The final decision is provided without an opportunity for a rebuttal. Submissions to Round 2 may be either new papers or revised papers from Round 1. Revised papers from Round 1 are re-evaluated based on the original reviews and the authors&rsquo; response. For revised submissions in round 2, we will do our best to have the same meta-reviewer and reviewers review the revised submission.</p><p>New papers can be submitted in either the first or the second round. The primary benefit of submitting in Round 1 is that submissions can be invited for resubmission to Round 2, enabling authors to address reviewer concerns and significantly improve their work.</p><p>Paper submissions are accepted through CMT:</p><p><a class=link href=https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/FG2026 rel=external>https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/FG2026</a></p><br><h4 class="heading heading--4" id=paper-templates-are-available-below>Paper templates are available below:</h4><ul><li><a class=link href=https://www.overleaf.com/read/vtbwkbhhbxpp#35990f rel=external>Overleaf LaTeX Template</a></li><li><a class=link href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RBOaG7JogyFI7nigzHjJfn36pHQ3rakp/view?usp=sharing" rel=external>LateX Template</a></li><li><a class=link href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nekOaVw4SB3U0HkgoKdf06mWzPmjDQQh/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=104016129676819843735&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true" rel=external>Word Template</a></li></ul><h4 class="heading heading--4" id=submissions-steps>Submissions steps</h4><ol><li>Prepare your manuscripts as per the IEEE specifications using the LaTeX or Word templates for both Long and Short Papers</li><li>Carefully proofread your submission</li><li>Submit to the FG 2026 CMT system: <a class=link href=https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/FG2026 rel=external>https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/FG2026</a></li></ol><p><strong>NOTE:</strong><br>a) List all authors during initial submission.
